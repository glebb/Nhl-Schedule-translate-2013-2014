Nhl Schedule translate 2013-2014
========

If you are like me, you live far from US ET -timezone, which makes it hard to check the schedule for nhl games from NHL site. Also, because the time difference is huge, I'm mostly interested in games which are not showing in the middle of the night locally. That's why I created this tool. It can filter the games you are interested in, by team and by "on-air" -hours. By default it will show games which start between 7:00 and 22:30. You can also set the timezone, if you don't live in Finland. Check the list of timezones from wikipedia.
